I'm at a mushroom
eating potatoes
i am a stupid weird elf
where have the times gone
when i was human
where did my mash potatoes go
HEY! Why did you steal my potatoes
I will chase you down
You better come back here with them 
or i will kill you right now.
I will tear your meat off
and i will cook 'em for lunch
I'm pretty sure it'll be tasty 
caus u stole my potatoes 
I've wasted my breath
chasing after you
I should shoot you now
and it will be donw
But you just won't die
I've been shooting you
for an eternity
I was at a mushroom
eating potatoes
minding my own business till you came 
Where have the times gone
eating potatoes
whihc is the only thing i eat
If happy ever after did exist
I will still be eating potatoes
I'm slowly losing some of my strength
My potatoes are out of my grasp
I am crying sadly
